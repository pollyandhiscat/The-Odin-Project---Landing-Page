# The-Odin-Project---Landing-Page
The Odin Project 'Landing Page' project. This project is built entirely in HTML and CSS.
This landing page is created by leveraging Flexbox. The landing page can be thought
of to be split up into distinct rows. Within each row, items are flexed and aligned.
This method allows quick additions of content while maintaining the organized
layout achieved with Flexbox.
